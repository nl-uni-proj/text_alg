This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins.
The Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind,
and people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich,
but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.
